The <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html" data-v-7a6ca3b1>Nextflow DSL2</a> implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from <a href="https://github.com/nf-core/modules" data-v-7a6ca3b1>nf-core/modules</a> in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community! </p><p class="body-content" data-v-7a6ca3b1> On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the <a href="https://nf-co.re/quantms/results" data-v-7a6ca3b1>nf-core website</a>. This gives you a hint on which reports and file types are produced by the pipeline in a standard run.
